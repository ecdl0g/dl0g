DL0G Core 
==========

The DL0G blockchain uses the discrete logarithm problem over elliptic curves as the mining algorithm.
Eventually a service will be added to place bounties on ecdlog problems on the blockchain. Where you
can provide a curve, a modulus,two points on the curve to solve the ecdlog problem and some amount
of dlog coins as a bounty for it. 

This is a fork of Bitcoin 29.x taken from the latest code in the master branch as of a day ago. Eventually,
this will be a fork of Bitcoin v30. As those changes will be integrated into the chain.

There is a second repo with the miner which you can use to mine.
